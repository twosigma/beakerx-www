title: BeakerX
text: > #
  BeakerX is a collection of kernels and extensions to the
  [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} interactive computing environment. It provides JVM support,
  Spark cluster support, polyglot programming, interactive plots, tables, forms, publishing, and more.  BeakerX supports:

    - Groovy, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, Java, and SQL, including many magics;
    - Widgets for time-series plotting, tables, forms, and more (there are Python and JavaScript APIs
      in addition to the JVM languages);
    - Polyglot magics and autotranslation, allowing you to access multiple languages in the same notebook, and seamlessly communicate between them;
    - [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} integration including GUI configuration, status, progress, interrupt, and tables;
    - One-click publication with interactive plots and tables, and
    - Jupyter Lab.

  BeakerX is available via conda, pip, and docker.

  Or try it live online with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/twosigma/beakerx/1.2.0?filepath=StartHere.ipynb){:target="_blank"}.

      Docker is a great way to run and manage servers including
      Jupyter with BeakerX built-in.  BeakerX has a
      [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/beakerx/beakerx/){:target="_blank"}
      distributed by Docker Hub so you can download and run it with
      just one command: `docker run -p 8888:8888 beakerx/beakerx`
